Switch MO to 32bit if it's not already 
it's good idea to play in windowed mode as well seems more stable
unzip the injector and put the .dll file into the same folder
launch MO
before you login open mo.exe a box should pop up saying it was hooked
now you're free to login and do whatever

If you're creating a character for the first time don't hit "enter game" or it will crash. Use "save" and then pick the character from the selection screen.
Suggested build is thursar-kallard max height, str and con. You don't need dex when you have a speedhack
